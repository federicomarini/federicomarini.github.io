      <description>Modern assay techniques have transformed biology into a data-rich science, and a fundamental component in the workflow of almost each scientific effort is represented by computational analyses. High-throughput sequencing applied to quantification of gene expression (RNA-sequencing) delivers at the same time an overview as well as plenty of details about the complex organization and regulation of transcriptome profiles for a set of biological samples. This high-dimensional assay, currently performed routinely by many research groups at the CTH, is, however, of little use without efficient biostatistics and bioinformatics methods to preprocess, analyze, and properly interpret them.</description>

      <description>Continuing to build upon the framework I developed in my doctoral studies (Marini and Binder, 2016), my objective is to design and develop a combination of methods, software, and resources, focused on the field of gene regulation in platelets.
I will leverage on the many existing platelets RNA-Seq datasets (either published or generated in-house) to assemble a common resource that will be seamlessly used by thrombosis and hemostasis researchers to integrate the available corpus of known transcriptomic profiles with own data.</description>
