Despite the availability of many software packages developed for this purpose, an interactive and comprehensive interface for performing these operations is lacking. We developed the pcaExplorer software package to enhance commonly performed analysis steps with an interactive and user-friendly application, which provides state saving as well as the automated creation of reproducible reports. pcaExplorer is implemented in R using the Shiny framework and exploits data structures from the open-source Bioconductor project. Users can easily generate a wide variety of publication-ready graphs, while assessing the expression data in the different modules available, including a general overview, dimension reduction on samples and genes, as well as functional interpretation of the principal components. pcaExplorer is distributed as an R package in the Bioconductor project (http://bioconductor.org/packages/pcaExplorer/), and is designed to assist a broad range of researchers in the critical step of interactive data exploration.","tags":[],"title":"pcaExplorer: an R/Bioconductor package for interacting with RNA-seq principal components","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Modern assay techniques have transformed biology into a data-rich science, and a fundamental component in the workflow of almost each scientific effort is represented by computational analyses. High-throughput sequencing applied to quantification of gene expression (RNA-sequencing) delivers at the same time an overview as well as plenty of details about the complex organization and regulation of transcriptome profiles for a set of biological samples. This high-dimensional assay, currently performed routinely by many research groups at the CTH, is, however, of little use without efficient biostatistics and bioinformatics methods to preprocess, analyze, and properly interpret them.\nThe choice of proper analysis tools, to be either adopted or newly developed, when addressing the challenges deriving from the specific scientific question, is an essential decision for the life scientist. Two essential aspects of academic software that I have been focusing on throughout my PhD work are interactivity and reproducibility, which unfortunately are not provided simultaneously by most available programs. My aim was to combine these two features for producing data analyses in an accessible, comprehensive and reproducible way (Marini and Binder, 2016).\nInteractive end-user interfaces are by their own nature an appealing tool to efficiently explore complex datasets by generating meaningful visualizations, thus reaching better insights into the data. At the same time, generation and sharing of scientific findings is greatly enhanced by a framework that records the fine subtleties in the methods used to transform raw data into the final publication results. With these two features, biologists and data analysts are brought together to reach a common ground and a better understanding of the complex biological systems under inspection. Moreover, reproducibility is regarded in the last years as an essential aspect of science. It serves two aims: first, public trust in impactful scientific projects is justified by allowing for transparent and independent verification, thus guaranteeing objective examination. Second, it is the key ingredient to advance science by allowing scientists to understand and build upon othersâ€™ ideas.\nThese aspects are also of primary importance when clinical and scientific competences are found together in one institute, such as the CTH, and an efficient interdisciplinarity is required for the successful translation of novel research findings.\n","date":1541289600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1541289600,"objectID":"ffff2a4253038cd9c29d582c0dd9296c","permalink":"/project/interrepro/","publishdate":"2018-11-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/interrepro/","section":"project","summary":"Developing tools enabling interactivity and reproducibility, for better analyses.","tags":["inter-repro"],"title":"Interactive and reproducible research","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Continuing to build upon the framework I developed in my doctoral studies (Marini and Binder, 2016), my objective is to design and develop a combination of methods, software, and resources, focused on the field of gene regulation in platelets.\nI will leverage on the many existing platelets RNA-Seq datasets (either published or generated in-house) to assemble a common resource that will be seamlessly used by thrombosis and hemostasis researchers to integrate the available corpus of known transcriptomic profiles with own data.\nThe overall aim of the proposed project is a deep understanding of the platelets gene regulation, occurring via cell signaling pathways of the hemostatic system, and their crosstalk with tumor progression and angiogenesis.
